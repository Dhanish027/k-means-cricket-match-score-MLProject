📊 Machine Learning Project: K-Means Clustering 🤖

🏏 Clusters Unveiled: K-Means came to the rescue, sorting data points into three distinct clusters, each representing a unique playing style. These clusters offer profound insights into the dynamic nature of cricket strategies.

📈 Centroid Revelations: By scrutinizing the centroids of each cluster, we pinpointed the average number of overs and scores that typify specific gameplay approaches. The numbers don’t lie!

🔍 Data Visualized: To enhance understanding, we employed data visualization techniques, showcasing the clusters and centroids on a scatter plot. It’s fascinating to see how overs and scores interplay.
